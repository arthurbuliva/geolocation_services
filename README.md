SWE6130: MOBILE APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT

This application provides a user with information based on geo-location proximity. We are interested with information on:
a) Schools
b) Hospitals
c) Restaurants/Hotels
 
A user needs to login into the application for authentication. The user then selects an area of interest from the list above, using a reasonable user interface. The application determines its current location then searches the nearest available selected services and shows them on a google map. The mobile device must have WIFI connection or mobile data enabled.
